# COVID Smackdown Protocol

A protocol for when u have covid, disclaimer not medical advice and all that liability stuff. be careful if u have other medical conditions and check for contraindications. i wrote this w the help of chatgpt. A personal COVID protocol that aggressively targets the virus from all angles: viral replication, inflammation, oxidative stress, and recovery. May knock covid out sooner and give continued support to prevent rebound or long COVID. u don't have to listen to everything on here (for ex if u know u already get enough zinc)

## IMPORTANT: DO NOT EXERCISE SOON AFTER COVID. EVEN FOR A MILD CASE GIVE IT TWO WEEKS I THINK

## 🚀 Day 1 Protocol (Symptoms or Positive Test)

- **Paxlovid** – Start *on the same day* as symptoms or positive test.
  - Purpose: Inhibits viral replication

- **Smoothie Ingredients:**
  - 🥦 **Broccoli sprouts** – Sulforaphane for NRF2 activation & antioxidant response
  - 🫐 **Berries** – Polyphenols & antioxidant power
  - 🧄 **Garlic** – Antimicrobial, immune modulator
  - 🟡 **Turmeric** – Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant

- **Sunlight exposure (shirtless)**
  - ☀️ To stimulate **vitamin D** synthesis naturally and support immune regulation

- **Multivitamin with Zinc** – Covers foundational micronutrients and supports immune response

- **Flax Oil (Omega-3s)** – Anti-inflammatory support via ALA (precursor to DHA/EPA)

---

## 🔁 Continued Protocol (for 5+ days after symptom resolution)
> To prevent Paxlovid rebound and ensure full recovery without long COVID

- **Continue smoothies** (broccoli sprouts, berries, garlic, turmeric)
- **Keep getting sunlight daily**
- **Maintain flax oil + multivitamin**

## 🧠 Optional / Advanced Add-Ons (be careful if you have other medical conditions and check to make sure there are no contraindications/check w dr)
> These elevate your protocol from elite to god-tier.

### 🔬 NAC (N-Acetylcysteine)
- Dose: 600–1200 mg/day (split dose)
- Boosts glutathione, thins mucus, reduces inflammation

### 🧪 Quercetin + Zinc
- Quercetin acts as a zinc ionophore (like a natural HCQ)
- Dose: 500 mg quercetin + 15–30 mg zinc/day
- Boost bioavailability with bromelain if desired

### 🌱 Black Seed Oil (Nigella sativa)
- Dose: 500 mg 1–2x/day
- Antiviral, bronchodilatory, anti-inflammatory

### 🧬 Omega-3s (EPA/DHA)
- If not getting through diet, consider supplementing 1–2g EPA+DHA
- Helps resolve inflammation and supports brain/vascular recovery

### 💤 Melatonin
- Dose: 3–10 mg before bed
- Sleep + antioxidant + immune regulatory support

### 🦠 Probiotics
- Restore gut health post-illness:
  - **Saccharomyces boulardii** or **L. rhamnosus GG**
  - Fermented foods: kimchi, tempeh
  - Prebiotics: inulin, pomegranate extract

## 🍎 Quercetin-Rich Foods
| Food | Quercetin (mg per 100g) |
|------|--------------------------|
| 🔴 Capers (pickled) | 233 mg |
| 🧅 Red onions (raw) | 33–55 mg |
| 🍏 Apples (with skin) | 3–10 mg |
| 🍇 Red grapes | 2–4 mg |
| 🍓 Berries | 3–7 mg |
| 🧄 Garlic | ~1–3 mg |
| 🌿 Herbs (lovage, dill) | 10–50 mg |
| 🫖 Tea (green/black) | ~2–5 mg per cup |

> Stacking a half onion + apple + tbsp capers + 2 cups tea = ~60mg daily

---

## 🧪 Quadannual Booster Strategy
> Based on real-world immunology and antibody decay data

- **0–2 months post-booster:** 55–65% protection against infection
- **2–4 months:** ~30–40%
- **>4 months:** drops below 20%

🧠 Boost every 3–4 months to stay in high protection zone most of the year.
Stack with lifestyle measures for synergistic protection.

---

## 😴 Sleep is a Weapon
- <6 hrs sleep = ~2x higher risk of infection vs 7–9 hrs
- Enhances NK cells, T-cells, vaccine response, lowers inflammation

Estimated protection vs COVID from good sleep = **~50% RRR**

---

## 🧬 Synergy Effect
When combining:
- 4x/year boosters (avg 50–60% RRR)
- Good sleep (50% RRR)
- Supplements (small direct but strong supportive role)
- Sunlight, zinc, sulforaphane, etc.

You’re likely getting **~70%+ effective protection against infection**, on top of massive risk reduction for severity.

## 🧪 Want to Level Up Further?
- Track inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin) during illness
- Monitor variant trends to time boosters during surges
- Build a booster calendar based on variant exposure and antibody timing
- Keep Paxlovid on hand for emergencies
